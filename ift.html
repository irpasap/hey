      <br/>At last ... Finally. what you eagerly waited is in your hands. As this is like your sent off gift i will try to keep as pleasant as possible, but may be i can't.. as u know i was quite genuine when it comes to u and your highly sarcastic behaviour😂. No offence😌, Here i starts...
      Hey bruhh don't be always self isolated on taking your dream quite serious. I know you will have your way of fun but try to join with others if had a chance., Waste some of your energy. and careful about new friends too, i don't know how far you trust someone🤔. Hmm.. one more thing don't show up your flawsome attitude if needed speak up. I don't know whether you had a plan or not. But for first year just settle down, don't plan to get a girlfriend at all. I know you don't need my advice, and it's definitely not a advice just a normal note. Haa just have good sleep. Don't stay up till mornings like it's your last day on earth😅. At least there, follow up some timings.<br/>
      <br/>
      Haa eat something healthy so please don't cook by yourself maybe that could ends up as a disaster😱. I'm just kidding😂 i never tasted the food you made just heard from u saying it will be good. I hope it was edible.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Never thought i would say this.. but here it is "9 w912l 13i19s 21" bruh. I can say it directly but wanted u put some effort to find it😂..I know it's a piece of cake for you. I wouldn't be saying this if you left earlier. But somehow it got delayed and past few months we do have time and quite good conversations which i am going to miss in future.😔
      <br/>
      <br/>
      But don't worry i will try to disturb you time to time.
      Thanks for hearing all my rubbish talks. The way you listens to my tiny stupid stuff with patience, I will remember. I am happy that u get what u desire for and even what i am waiting for to happen.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Well.. you won't be having a rubbish,and stupid stuff speaking friend like me there so you can save a lot of time and do something useful and productive. What do you say??  If you nod your head i swear, will curse you and I will kill u. Even i can't hear what u say just say ... "No, it's not true!" ... For my satisfaction.
      If everything goes in right way u will achieve what you desires in easy way without much strain. If something goes wrong use your stubbornness and make it work even it seems hard to handle.<br/>

      "When nothing goes as expected, then try to turn the hurdles as opportunities"<br/>
      <br/>
      I know it sounds little unrealistic but it helps to stay positive and find alternatives.<br/>
      <br/>
      I know you're aware of it, Just remember it.<br/>

      I really don't like to say this but wanted to say it anyway.. Sorry if I ever hurt you by my  invisible and highly negligible rudeness. 😅<br/>
      <br/>
      
      You're really good friend of mine. That's why may be I took little more liberty. Sometimes would have said things that make u feel like i am arguing, But i am not, seriously, that's the way how i speak with people whom I was comfortable and have good relation. I will remember our conversations and fun for sure, haa even your existence.<br/>
      <br/>
      
      I don't speak with you as a favour. I do because I just like our talks. Literally i would have a lot of different things to do but still why i am giving time and speaking with u?  Definitely not bcoz doing favour for you. Even u consumes a lot of my energy. I still likes to continue... Because u really offers me Liberty and freedom to speak whatever i wanted to and however i like to. You're a good friend.  And when you compare it with favour and force kind of words i really don't like it. You're really a big dumb 🐒.<br/>
      <br/>
      
      And i don't have much secrets as you say or u think, ask... they were just some insecurities. Difficult to make one understand 🤷. U already knew half story about my mom's and mine. The other part i don't like to speak with anyone as i come across quite lot at young age from my own family i hate to get attach with anyone or have any kind of dependent feelings. I don't know how come I shared that many things with you. May be it's because you won't react much over anything, and haahha I thought u will left soon and never going to meet. <br/>
      <br/>
      
      🤔 Did i missed anything?? Haaa i forgot to speak some good stuff about u. 😴 I am sleepy thinking about good things. okay okay 😂😂 koni unnai le... I hate to say,but haa.. i am jealous of you're patience level and calmness. I don't know how u speak with others but you act cool most of time with me. Even that annoys me. I like you're childish nature at times😂, i don't know neekuda appud appudu kopam ostadhani osthe chinna pillodivi ipotav ani. Hard work chestav nachina dani kosam. I like that. Lazy anntav kani mari antha em kadhani naa opinion. At Last one more compliment you're the most insane, annoying person that i met in my life😂😂<br/>
      <br/>
      
      I wish you finish MS and land on your dream job without any time dragging hurdles.<br/>
      <br/>
      
      Good luck ja-• 👊👊 I really like to call u with this name😂😂.<br/>
      <br/>
      
      Take care.⊂⁠(⁠(⁠・⁠▽⁠・⁠)⁠)⁠⊃<br/>
      <br/>
      
      I am sure,  atmost I included all the things which u expected to hear and not. Did I missed about anything? 🤔<br/>
      <br/>
      
      Haaaa do remember me!!😁 I don't think we have the possibility to meet in future, still i never felt our friendship was lack of closeness which possess on years of friendship. Even it's just been months that we known each other.<br/>
      <br/>
      
      Long story short lines...i try to make it very pleasant, actually it is so cool.<br/>
      <br/>
      
      At first.. we got to know the names, turns to have negligible talks, next it's turns to exploratory talks.<br/><br/>
      Later you starts to speak, I turns to talk more. <br/><br/>
      As days passed, you turned into a good listener, and I turns to good at narration.<br/><br/>
      You turns to annoy, I turns to get annoyed lot.<br/><br/> 
      You turns to unbelievable/ unreasonable, I got to see a child.<br/><br/>
      You turns to Laughter, when I turns to annoyed myself.<br/><br/> 
      You turns to detective, when I turns to be foolish.<br/><br/>
      You turns to be a keeper,when I turns to dictate life's drama.<br/><br/>
      Slowly little later you turns to be good friend than I expected <br/>
      <br/>
      Thanks for that good time and being a good friend. Haa okay okay calm down even I am a good friend. Yeah u can thank me too...<br/>
      <br/>
      See that's all I thought to sent it if I didn't get a chance to meet you. But somehow I got a chance to catch up and see you(the innocent face boy) at the end. But I feel why to keep it if I plan to sent. right?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Okay don't laugh over it if anything seems funny. I tried to make it sound reasonable than funny!!
